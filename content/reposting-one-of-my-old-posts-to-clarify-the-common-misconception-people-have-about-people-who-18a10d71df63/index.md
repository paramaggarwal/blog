> The philosophy of minimalism, as I see it, is having exactly what you need, when you need it, for as long as you need it. It’s not about just less, it’s about just right.

Reposting one of my old posts to clarify the common misconception people have about people who believe in minimalism. Minimalist people don’t give up worldly desires or become saints or go to the forest. Minimalism simply means to have a less confusing life. To get rid of what is not needed. To reduce complications.

Making life complicated is easy, simplifying it is difficult.
