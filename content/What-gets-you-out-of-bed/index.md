An interesting question to ask yourself. I often find it difficult to wake up in the morning. For the simple reason that I didn’t know what I would do if I woke up.

But on days that I have something planned, my body automatically gets up earlier than usual. Getting up and ready becomes involuntary.

This is a question you have to answer every day of your life. Hopefully your answer is, ’_My dream_.’ The dream that you see at night and work towards through the day, everyday.
