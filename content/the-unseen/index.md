What all did you see today?

You helped a person pick their dropped book, but you didn’t see them smile back. It’s the unseen.

You tipped the waiter, but you didn’t see him bow and thank you. It’s the unseen.

You hurried past a person carrying his food, but you didn’t see that you almost made him drop it. It’s the unseen.

Your supposedly funny joke hurt someone, but you didn’t see the faintest of the expression he let leak on his face. It’s the unseen.

Everyday, there are things that you miss.

See.
