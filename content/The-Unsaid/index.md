You have 2 minutes to make an impression. Capture the moment. Be the person.

Once it has passed, the window has closed.

No one gives a damn. It’s the unsaid.

Nobody is going to tell you something, because you didn’t say anything. What is the response to not saying anything? It’s the unsaid.

Express when the ears are listening, the eyes are open and the sun is shining. What is the opposite of not expressing? It’s the unsaid.

There are a ton of things that nobody is going to sit you down, and teach you. It’s the unsaid.

Respect the unsaid. Say.
