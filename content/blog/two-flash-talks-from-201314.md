## Summarising two flash talks I did a few years ago, and how the ideas still continue to be open problems today in 2017!

At JSFoo 2013, a Javascript conference in Bangalore — in a turn of events, I gave a small 5 minute flash talk with my friend [Chetan Agrawal](https://medium.com/@chetan1507).

Today in a world of web-apps, everything runs in the browser, but that means that the web-app itself needs to load every time you access the site. How about the server render it the first time so that you can see the content straight-away?

At [MetaRefresh 2014](http://metarefresh.in), I gave a small 3min flash talk about a little project of mine. MetaRefresh is a conference for user interfaces on the web. It’s a yearly event in Bangalore.

Front-end engineers are in a position of power today. Node.js, browser-side frameworks like Angular/React, back-end services like Pusher/Parse/Firebase and mobile app platforms like PhoneGap — basically mean that a front-end engineer can build an entire app, make it realtime and also make it work on all mobile devices. This is insane!
