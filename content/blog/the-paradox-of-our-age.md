> _We have bigger houses but smaller families;  
> more conveniences, but less time._

> _We have more degrees but less sense;  
> more knowledge but less judgment;  
> more experts, but more problems;  
> more medicines but less healthiness._

> _We’ve been all the way to the moon and back,  
> but have trouble in crossing the street to meet our new neighbor._

> _We built more computers to hold more copies than ever,  
> but have less real communication;  
> We have become long on quantity,  
> but short on quality._

> _These are times of fast foods but slow digestion;  
> Tall men but short characters;  
> Steep profits but shallow relationships._

> _It’s a time when there is much in the window but nothing in the room._

> _\- The Dalai Lama_
