Right now, think of at least 10 people who’s phone numbers you remember.

Pass? Great, this post is probably not for you. You are doing great without tech.

Fail? So, you got less than 10 files on the system and all the other backed up to the cloud? What will you do during an emergency? What will you do if you lost your phone for a few days?

With the advent of tech, we are now moving our brains to the cloud. Many of us use apps and notes to jot down all that we need to do. We have calendars. Anything that we feel we might have to remember, we make the computer remember it. We take pictures of all the interesting things we see. We take videos to remember each and every moment. Are we utilizing memory any longer?

Our memory is more like address pointers now. We just remember where each of those photos, videos, notes is stored. Oh no, actually we don’t. Thats why we need desktop search and bookmarks for all the sites we visit.

Alas, another way in which tech is drowning the true human ability to remember and forget things. Yes, forgetting is a good thing too. Remember?
