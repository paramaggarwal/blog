Be you means firmly believing in what you believe in. Things like telling the truth. Helping people. Keeping your point of view.

Be you means to be an individual, and not mix into the crowd.

Be you means to have confidence in yourself.

Be you is to say ‘hell with people who don’t agree’.

Be you is to stand alone on the other side of the river.

Be you is to take the rusty path.

Be you is to be the ‘I’.

Be you is praying to the power that is you.

Be you is jumping into the river even when people say its deep. Doing what you are passionate about, no matter what.

B U is being yourself.
