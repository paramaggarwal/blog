Amazon launched the new line of Kindle reading devices and Kindle Fire tablets yesterday. It was a great [unveiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi1jZXz9Kg): product demos, ship dates and unbelievable pricing. Gruber is [impressed](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/06/amazon-event).

Though much has improved with the devices, I think we are seeing a bigger change with Jeff Bezos and his company: Amazon. When I saw him on stage, he seemed more mature, more intense that I have ever seen him before. Fighting to build a great service and leave behind a lasting company.

The keynote reminded me of someone else: Steve Jobs and his company: Apple. He has been a great inspiration to every builder and hacker of this generation; dreaming to put a dent in the universe as he would call it.

At first notice, it looks like a blatant rip-off of his style. Telling a story about the product. Making the case for the device. The clean and simple stage with a black background. Inspiring product videos. Even talking about where a product fits in with their strategy.

But looking deeper, it is an acknowledgement. True inspiration. Each and every aspect of the Amazon Kindle keynote was a tribute to Steve Jobs and his presentation style.

Pointing out the tiny details about the device, that might go unnoticed. Making it clear how much love has been poured into the device. Building up the hype over what the product can do and then dramatically unveiling the low price. Emphasing the values of the company towards the end. It all goes down to say one thing, Jeff bezos wants to build his own legacy.

This is a man who has been inspired so deeply, that it shows. Steve took Apple from two guys in his parents garage, to the most valuable company on the planet. I think Bezos is thinking no smaller.

Kudos to Jeff for the amazing company he is building with Amazon. Kudos to Steve for inspiring an entire generation.
