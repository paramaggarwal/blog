Photography means ‘painting with light’. It is an art form just like painting. A photo sensitive film is taken, exposed to the scene that is to be captured and developed. The film, the camera and the chemicals used are all tools of the trade.

Recently the essence of photography has come under question for the use of post-processing tools like Adobe Lightroom and Apple Aperture. Why shouldn’t the camera do everything?

In film photography, if the film is under or over exposed during a shot, the only way to correct it is to use chemicals while developing the film. This is a _fix_. No chemical can bring back the details lost to improper exposure. Chemicals are not a way to _make_ photos, they are a tool to _enhance_ them.

Hence the existence of post processing tools is in no means an excuse to improperly light your subject expecting to be able to fix it in post processing. These tools exist to give you creative freedom. They allow us to give a dramatic effect to photographs. They allow us to turn it from what the eye sees everyday into a work of art.

In art, nothing is impure. What matters is the form and expression of the photograph.
