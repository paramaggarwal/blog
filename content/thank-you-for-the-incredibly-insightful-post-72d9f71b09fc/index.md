Thank you for the incredibly insightful post. I’m inspired by your use of visualising the network to always understand it deeply, something I believe is given second priority in the complex network architectures of today.

The idea of using networks to get the job done but then also keep an eye on how confident the network feels, is really powerful.

I’m a student of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer [Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/drive) and shared your post in our student forums as more people can benefit from approaching neural networks in a _visualise-first_ mindset.
