I have a very different view on the whole heaven/hell thing. What we are made to believe is that if we do good things, we go to heaven and if we do bad things then we go to hell. Which I believe is true, but not in the literal sense.

I believe that maybe this life that we are living is actually hell or the end of another life we were living elsewhere. It is as possible as it sounds crazy. So after we died in that other world we came into this world which might be heaven or hell. But depending on our outlook of life some may consider this life as heaven and some as hell.

The point I am trying to make is that if a person looks onto life as some hell and rebels against it, he will end up doing bad things. A person who looks onto life as heaven will enjoy it and call it heaven. So even if they ended up in the same world after they died the rebelious one will call life hell and the good one will consider life heaven.

So according to tradition they went to respective heaven/ hell even though they are in the same world and that world might simply be the one we live in.

Moral: Our view on life is what life becomes.
