‘What is success?’, someone asked. Some paid attention, some didn’t. It’s such a core question of our lives, so elementary, that its easy to dismiss it as so.

I asked myself, and the ‘I’ said: “Success is in now.” I thought ‘Wow, so simple’. But what does it even mean? It seems like an answer to ‘Where is success.’ It makes no sense. For a few hours it seemed crap.

And then it came: It made sense. It was brilliant.

Success is in _now_. Success is not a result, its a process. You do it every time you have the ability to do something. And you have the ability to do something in the _now_, never again in the past, never again in the future.

If you can do that thing, that one thing you really love, right now, every moment of your life, again and again, you have succeeded in _now_. It is in _now_ that the decisions are taken and the journey travelled.

If you can be mindful of the present and appreciate the present, you have succeeded. You are already there — what we do _now_, is what our life is, what it’s all about.

_Now_ is you; every moment of your life. Succeed at each one of them.
