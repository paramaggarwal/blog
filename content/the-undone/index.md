It was perfectly possible to have found time to meet friends, but you didn’t. It’s the undone.

It was a beautiful shirt, you could have bought it. It’s the undone.

It was a good side-project, you could have taken it up. It’s the undone.

It was a superb rainy day, you could have taken a splash. It’s the undone.

It was a good pasta, you could have let the chef know. It’s the undone.

Everyday there are things that could have been done, but became the undone.

Do.
