One week, me and a friend went along to Mahalaxmi Race Course in Mumbai. Every weekend hobbyists get together and fly remote-controlled planes. These are not the measly battery operated kind. They run on fuel and have actual engines that drive propellers.

Their remotes look complicated. And the whole process of getting it to take off seemed fairly complex.

But they are so awesome.

Here is a video of one taking off.

Now this was a surprise. One of these was actually powered by a jet engine. A real jet engine like you find in commercial planes. Really cool. Check out the sound it made.

It was also able to go straight up. Crazy.
