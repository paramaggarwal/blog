The Nokia 3310 was an immensely popular phone, and now we reap the benefits…

We get a 84x48 monochrome graphic LCD for almost nothing (around 100 Rs). It is easily available at Lamington Road or at any friendly mobile repair shop.

I used the 8051 iBoard available at triindia.co.in to control it:

The pinout of the Nokia 3310 Display is as follows:

Nokia 3310 LCD Pinouts:

-   VCC — Power Supply (5V)
-   SCK — Serial Clock
-   SDI — Serial Data In
-   DC — Data/Command
-   CE — Chip Enable
-   GND — Ground
-   Vout — Contrast
-   RES — Reset Pin

Now, the pins at the back of the LCD are quite close, so carefully solder 7 wires to the back of the display, leaving out Vout. After this we will connect the display on to the board:

I used the following:

-   P1\_1 — SCK
-   P1\_2 — D/C
-   P1\_3 — RST
-   P1\_4 — DATA
-   P1\_5 — CE

Thats it, we are done. Now burn the code on to the board.

This project was done during my internship at robo.in a division of TRI Technosolutions now [Thinklabs](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fthinklabs.in&t=ZGU0Njk3MThmZDE3ZjA5NDZjZDljYTQwMzFkZWFjMTdmY2JkZTRiMyxCWkg0NkhHZQ%3D%3D). It is a start-up that takes robotics workshops for school and engineering kids.

Similarly using a software called FastLCD, I managed the following:
