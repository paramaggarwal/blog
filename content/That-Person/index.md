So smart. So handsome. So on-top-of-things.  
So social. So helpful. So lets-do-this-today.

I want to be that person.

Because I am dull.  
I am lazy.  
I am slow.  
I am not-so-doing-this-today.

Problem is,  
I am me.

So-not-good.

But flip it over.  
You be him.  
He becomes you.  
And the story is the same.

Everyone likes everyone else.

The power of You. Which is the Me.
