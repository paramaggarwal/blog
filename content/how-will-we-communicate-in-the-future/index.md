The song playing on the radio was ‘chitti aayi re aayi re chitti aayi, watan ki mitti aayi’.

And it brought to my mind the beauty of physicality. The touch of paper, the smell of the ink. The knowledge that the person who sent it had touched the same paper.

I wished that I could send such a letter that would sing this song, when opened.

And it clicked me.

The first episode was the postal service. Physical mail.

The second was email. It digitized post entirely.

The third episode would be something that combines the beauty of both. I don’t know what it might look like. Imagine.

But I do know this:

“Intelligent electronics has the potential to bring back the lost physicality of the digitized IT world.”

Just thought of this today. I believe this will be the defining idea of my entire career.
