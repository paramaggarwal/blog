I came across these amazing rules on how to live life. Worth sharing and remembering.

1.  Do one thing at a time.
2.  Do it slowly and deliberately.
3.  Do it completely. Put your mind completely on the task. Don’t move on to the next task until you’re finished.
4.  Do less.
5.  Put space between things.
6.  Develop rituals.
7.  Designate time for certain things.
8.  Devote time to sitting.
9.  Smile and serve others.
10.  Make cleaning and cooking become meditation.
11.  Think about what is necessary.
12.  Live simply.
