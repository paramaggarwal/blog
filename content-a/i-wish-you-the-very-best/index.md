## But also wish you the hard and difficult things.

> _I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright.  
> I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more.  
> I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive.  
> I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.  
> I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting.  
> I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess.  
> I wish enough_ Hello’s _to get you through the final_Goodbye_._
