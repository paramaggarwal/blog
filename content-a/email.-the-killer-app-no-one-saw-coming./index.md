## And still doesn’t.

1.  Your unique identity across the web.
2.  The first notification system.
3.  The first to-do manager.
4.  The first note-taker.
5.  The first social-network.
6.  The first project management app.
7.  The first read later app.
8.  The first file transfer app.
9.  The first backup system.
10.  The first photo sharing app.

All that and more. With e_mail_.
