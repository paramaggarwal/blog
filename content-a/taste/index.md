Taste is preference. A like and dislike.

Taste is crucial. It defines you.

Love some things, hate others.

It is about having opinions. Strong beliefs that you fight for. To take a stand.

Go ahead. Like and dislike. Ignore others, their tastes are different.

People without taste are boring. They are ok with everything. They are character-less. They just live along trying to please everybody. What defines them?

Express your opinion. Stick with it. Be tasteful.
